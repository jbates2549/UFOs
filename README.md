# UFO Analysis using Javascript
Analysis of UFO sightings using HTML and Javascript

## Overview
For this analysis we used Javascript and HTML to develop a web page that allows the user to view data for UFO sightings.  The user can filter the results of the sightings by entering location data or the shape of the sighting.  We used D3 coding to allow the user to interact with teh database through the web interface.

## Results
The imaage below shows the layout of the web page.  
*  Users can select Date, City, State, Country or shape to filter the results for specific criteria.
*  Multiple filters can be used to filter the data by both location and shape.
*  The page will load all data by default when no filters are selected.



## Summary
The page works well with the supplied date.  However, it could be improved in at least 2 ways. 1.  if the form allowed users to enter comments the page would be more interactive.  Also, the page does not have a mechanism to add new sightings to the database interactively.
